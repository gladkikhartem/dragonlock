# Dragon Lock  (WIP)
A swiss-knife synchronisation server that will make your life easier. Featuring:

* **Distributed Locks**
    * Long-Polling - lock for one client returns right after unlock made by another client
    * Persistent - locks are persisted to disk and continue to block upon reboot for specified time
    * > 1k sequential lock/unlock operations per second for a single key
    * > 10k clients waiting on a lock for a single key
* **KV store with change notifications**
    * Strong Consistency - all operations either succeed or fail and written to disk before returning
    * Long Polling for Change Notifications - get notified about value change in milliseconds.
    * Up to 100k req/sec on an average server
    * Up to 10k watchers for a single key
* **Concurrency helpers**
    * Counters
    * Sequences
    * IdempotencyKey support for all operations

Spend $5 on single server and save months of your time on not worrying about:
- database transactions & conflicts
- concurrent background actions executed at the same time
- on-the-fly config updates
- redis setup & maintenance just to share a few values between apps

## Why not use Consul / etcd / Postres / DynamoDB?
This API solves a problem of Lock Contention and latency overhead of typical Distributed Lock solutions by sacrificing High-Availability.

By having only 1 server - it's possible to leverage in-memory mutexes to orchestrate the locking process and make overall design much much simpler, resulting in incredible performance and minimal latency.

If you know that lock overhead is just 0.5ms + round-trip latency and you can have 100k req/second for your whole solution - many simpler architecture options become available. Such as:
- Perform all operations sequentially for given key
- Read directly from local in-memory cache if request came to same server
- Batch multiple updates together & update DB once
- Share state between 100s of servers where every server can update the state every second.

## Current status
This is Work In Progress right now.
Stability testing, docs, admin endpoints & UI are required.

## API Guarantees:
Whole request is executed atomically - either all changes applied or none.

All changes are persisted to disk before success response is returned.

## Usage Examples:
Lock key "ABC" for 30 seconds. Wait for 30 seconds to acquire the lock
```
POST /db/my_env
{
    "LockID": "ABC",
    "LockDur": 30,
    "LockWait": 30
}
resp 200:
{
    "Lock":  1235553,
    "Till": 172343434, // Unix
}
```

Set some values & increment counter
```
POST /db/my_env
{
    "KVSet": ["Key": "ABC", "Value": "123"],
    "KVGet":  ["Key": "CDE"],
    "Atomic": ["Key": "Total_Count", "Add": 1]
}
resp 200:
{
    "Atomic": ["Key": "Total_Count", "Value": 333]
    "KV": ["Key": "CDE", "Value": { "my_json": "object" }]
}
```

Unlock id
```
POST /db/my_env
{
    "UnlockID": "ABC",
    "Unlock": "1235553",
}
resp 200:
{}
```


Idempotent update (without lock)
```
POST /db/my_env
{
    "IdempotencyIDs": ["ABC_create"],
    "KVSet": ["Key": "ABC", "Value": "123"],
    "Atomic": ["Key": "Total_Count", "Add": 1]
}
resp 200:
{
    "Atomic": ["Key": "Total_Count", "Value": 333]
}
```

Try duplicate request
```
POST /db/my_env
{
    "IdempotencyIDs": ["ABC_create"],
    "KVSet": ["Key": "ABC", "Value": "123"],
    "Atomic": ["Key": "Total_Count", "Add": 1]
}
resp 409:
{
    "Code": "duplicate_request"
}
```


Watch for key change
```
POST /watch/my_env
{
    "ID": "ABC",
    "Version": 0, // watch for key creation
}
resp - ... blocking until the key is created
```

Update key from another app
```
POST /db/my_env
{
    "KVSet": ["Key": "ABC", "Value": "123"],
}
```

Now watch request unblocks
```
... resp
{
    "Key": "ABC",
    "Version": 54,
    "Value": "123"
}
```

Try to wait for key change, but key was already changed since we looked at it last time
```
POST /watch/my_env
{
    "ID": "ABC",
    "Version": 32, // last version we had was 32
}
resp - unblocked immediately - current version is higher
{
    "Key": "ABC",
    "Version": 54,
    "Value": "123"
}
```

Try to wait for key change, but for current version of the key
```
POST /watch/my_env
{
    "ID": "ABC",
    "Version": 54, // watch for key change
}
resp ... - blocked until value is updated again
{
    "Key": "ABC",
    "Version": 54,
    "Value": "123"
}
```
